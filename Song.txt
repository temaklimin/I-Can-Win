My head is haunting me and my heart feels like a ghost
I need to feel something,
Cause I'm still so far from home
Cross your heart and hope to die
Promise me you'll never leave my side

Show me what I can't see
When the spark in my eyes is gone
You got me on my knees, I'm your one man cult
Cross my heart and hope to die
Promise you I'll never leave your side
